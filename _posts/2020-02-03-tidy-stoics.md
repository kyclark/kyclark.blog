I've been reading _A Guide to the Good Life_ by William B. Irvine and _The Life-changing Magic of Tidying up_ by Marie Kondo.
Irvine's book is about the ancient Stoic philosophers and how he has applied their guidance to his life, and Kondo discusses her work in helping people organize their living and work spaces.
Both books advocate for having less stuff.
The idea of trimming down my possessions has been percolating for a while, and I think these two authors have convinced me of the need to purge things I don't need from my life.

The KonMari method would have me start with my clothes, which I think is a fine place to start.
I ought to put *all* my clothes into a heap on the floor and sort them out, but this morning I decided I could at least starting thinning my hanging clothes.
I know my chest of drawers will need serious consideration as I often stuff my t-shirts so that I can close the drawers.
Also, I'm not sure I want to give up rolling my socks inside each other for storage, but I may consider her advice there.
Anyway, point is that I know I have accumulated too many clothes.

Kondo suggests that having fewer things will lead to calmer environment, and Irvine teaches that the Stoics valued tranquility above all else.
Tranquility is definitely a worthy goal, and I need to cultivate more of that in my life.
I've been trying to figure out what some of my bigger goals will be for 2020, and I think this sort of tiding/purging will figure heavily.
