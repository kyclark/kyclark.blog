I wrote a book with [Manning Publications](http://manning.com) called [Tiny Python Projects](https://www.manning.com/books/tiny-python-projects?a_aid=youens&a_bid=b6485d52).
The [coding exercises](https://github.com/kyclark/tiny_python_projects) was created over the last couple of years teaching beginning Python skills at the university level.
I found that giving my students tests and having them write code to satisfy the tests took all the guesswork out of assignments.
It gave the students a clear guide to what was expected, and failing tests include the feedback needed to correct their programs.
I think that [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) is often saved as some sort of advanced topic or it is expected th people will learn when they move to industry.
I think it's better to teach it right at the beginning to novice programmers so they will internalize the ideas of testing and will therefore write better code.
I hope this book teaches that.
