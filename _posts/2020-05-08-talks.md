I've given a couple of interviews and presentations that people might be interested to follow.

## Profitable Python with Ben McNeill

I talked with Ben McNeill for an hour or so about how I got into coding and such. It was a fun discussion, and Ben is a really kind person. You can (https://player.fm/series/profitable-python/learn-python-from-a-bioinformatics-hacker-ken-youens-clark)[listen to the whole interview here].

## Remote Python Pizza

Some amazing people put together a one-day, remote-only conference of Python talks. 
I was lucky enough to be chosen, and I talked about using test-driven development to teach beginners.
I put all my slides and example code (https://github.com/kyclark/remote.python.pizza)[into a GitHub repo].

## Upcoming

I've also had a chance to speak with Felipe at (https://www.datafuturology.com/)[Data Futurology] and Dustin at (https://sysadminshow.com/)[The SysAdminShow], and I'm looking forward to talking to Grant at (https://develomentor.com/)[Develomentor].

I summarized the ideas from SysAdminShow interview into a (https://github.com/kyclark/sysadminshow)[GitHub repo] that contains an discussion about moving sysadmin-type tasks from bash to Python along with many code examples.
