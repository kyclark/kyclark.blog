I've given a couple of interviews and presentations that people might be interested to follow.

## Profitable Python with Ben McNeill

I talked with Ben McNeill for an hour or so about how I got into coding and such. It was a fun discussion, and Ben is a really kind person. You can [listen to the whole interview here](https://player.fm/series/profitable-python/learn-python-from-a-bioinformatics-hacker-ken-youens-clark).

## Remote Python Pizza

Some amazing people put together a one-day, remote-only conference of Python talks. 
I was lucky enough to be chosen, and I talked about using test-driven development to teach beginners.
I put all my slides and example code [into a GitHub repo](https://github.com/kyclark/remote.python.pizza).

## Upcoming

I've also had a chance to speak with Felipe at [Data Futurology](https://www.datafuturology.com/) and Dustin at [The SysAdminShow](https://sysadminshow.com/), and I'm looking forward to talking to Grant at [Develomentor](https://develomentor.com/).

I summarized the ideas from SysAdminShow interview into a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kyclark/sysadminshow) that contains an discussion about moving sysadmin-type tasks from bash to Python along with many code examples.
