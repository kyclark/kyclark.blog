I've been working with Mannning Publications for several months on editing my first book.
It teaches Python programming using test-driven development ideas.
I anticipate the book will make it to the Manning Early Access Program (MEAP) sometime soon-ish, so it's as good a time as any to finally (re)establish a web presence.
