I'm Ken Youens-Clark. 
I wrote a book with (Manning Publications)[http://manning.com] called (Tiny Python Projects)[https://www.manning.com/books/tiny-python-projects?a_aid=youens&a_bid=b6485d52].
My day job is writing bioinformatics code at the University of Arizona.
I also like to write, cook, play music, and ride bicycles.
