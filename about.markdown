## Professional Experience

### Author

**Tiny Python Projects (Manning, 2020)**

[https://www.manning.com/books/tiny-python-projects](https://www.manning.com/books/tiny-python-projects)

This text grew from the materials I developed teaching basic programming skills to undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Arizona. The crux of the text is teaching how to write tested, documented, and reproducible programs. We use Python to explore the principles of test-driven development (TDD).
